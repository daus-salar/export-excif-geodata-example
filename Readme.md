##  How does it work?

The program reads the exif data of all pictures in the folder `pictures` at the current path and writes all unique gps coordinates found in a output file `out.csv` and `out.gpx`. 

## TODOs

* refactor the code of the main class to more readable code
* search for used coordinates with a fuzzy equals
